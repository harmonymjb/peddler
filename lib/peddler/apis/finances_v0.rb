    # Selling Partner API for Finances
    #
    # The Selling Partner API for Finances provides financial information that is relevant to a seller's business. You
    # can obtain financial events for a given order, financial event group, or date range without having to wait until a
    # statement period closes. You can also obtain financial event groups for a given date range.
    class FinancesV0 < API
      # Returns financial event groups for a given date range. Orders from the last 48 hours might not be included in
      # financial events.
      #
      # @note This operation can make a static sandbox call.
      # @param max_results_per_page [Integer] The maximum number of results per page. If the response exceeds the
      #   maximum number of transactions or 10 MB, the response is `InvalidInput`.
      # @param financial_event_group_started_before [String] A date that selects financial event groups that opened
      #   before (but not at) a specified date and time, in [ISO
      #   8601](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/iso-8601) format. The date-time must be after
      #   `FinancialEventGroupStartedAfter` and more than two minutes before the time of request. If
      #   `FinancialEventGroupStartedAfter` and `FinancialEventGroupStartedBefore` are more than 180 days apart, no
      #   financial event groups are returned.

      #   (or at) a specified date and time, in [ISO 8601](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/iso-8601)

      # @param next_token [String] The response includes `nextToken` when the number of results exceeds the specified
      #   `pageSize` value. To get the next page of results, call the operation with this token and include the same
      #   arguments as the call that produced the token. To get a complete list, call this operation until `nextToken`
